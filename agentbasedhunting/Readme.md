# Agent Based Modeling of hunting   

I made a arena-like environment for agents (mice) to get towards other agents (crickets) which produce noise. I started to link their behaviors (crickets do not chirp if the mouse recently moved) but let the project sit due to other priorities.


## How to Run

Launch the model:
```
    $ python server.py
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

=======
* Launch the visualization
```
$ mesa runserver
```
* Visit your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8521/
* In your browser hit *run*
